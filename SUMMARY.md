**TICaM: A Time-of-Flight In-Car Cabin Monitoring Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and monocular depth estimation tasks. It is used in the safety and automotive industries. 

The dataset consists of 19368 images with 40682 labeled objects belonging to 17 different classes including *person*, *ff*, *rf*, and other: *winter jacket*, *child*, *backpack*, *infant*, *box*, *water bottle*, *mobile phone*, *accessory*, *book*, *handbag*, *blanket*, *laptop*, *laptop bag*, and *background*.

Images in the TiCaM: Real Images dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. There are 10036 (52% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (13998 images) and *test* (5370 images). Additionally, images are grouped by ***im id***. Also every image contains information about its ***sequence***, ***activity***, ***duration***, ***person id***, ***status***. Images labels have ***low remission*** tag. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Germany Research Center for Artificial Intelligence.
